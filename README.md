## Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service
is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app


## PaaS can be delivered in three ways:

+  As a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS)
+ As a private service (software or appliance) behind a firewall.
+ As software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.
